  <!-- Student Projects -->
<section class="text-section">
  <h2>🛠️ Student Projects Showcase</h2>
  <p>Our Computer Engineering students take pride in developing solutions that bridge innovation with real-world application. These projects are not only part of their coursework but often compete in school-wide or national events.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Smart Helmet System:</strong> An intelligent safety helmet that detects collision impact and sends an automatic emergency alert via GSM module. It also includes a GPS tracker and LED indicators for low-light riding.</li>
    <li><strong>IoT Plant Monitor:</strong> This cloud-based monitoring system uses sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, and light levels. It sends alerts to a mobile app when the plant needs water or attention, ideal for sustainable urban farming.</li>
    <li><strong>Line Follower Robot:</strong> A programmable robot using infrared sensors to follow a predefined path. It won the National Robotics Challenge for its precision, responsiveness, and modular codebase.</li>
    <li><strong>Face Recognition Attendance System:</strong> Built using Python and OpenCV, this project allows automated attendance using a webcam, eliminating the need for manual input or RFID scans.</li>
    <li><strong>Capstone: Community Disaster Alert App:</strong> A mobile application that broadcasts disaster warnings, evacuation routes, and real-time updates during calamities. Integrated with government data APIs and offline fallback maps.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Leadership -->
<section class="text-section">
  <h2>👥 Leadership Opportunities</h2>
  <p>Beyond technical growth, our organization nurtures leadership potential. Students are encouraged to take active roles such as project managers, club officers, event coordinators, and peer mentors.</p>
  <p>Through these roles, students learn how to delegate tasks, manage timelines, and communicate effectively with both peers and faculty. Our leadership programs often include workshops on public speaking, conflict resolution, and team dynamics, helping prepare students not just for their careers, but for life.</p>

  <h2>🗣️ Student Voices</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “Being part of the CE Society has helped me build confidence in coding and presenting technical projects. The mentorship I received from upperclassmen made a big difference in my first year.”<br>
    <strong>— John M., 4th Year CE Student</strong>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    “Joining the robotics team gave me real-world experience with microcontrollers and teamwork. I never imagined myself leading a team at a national competition, but here I am!”<br>
    <strong>— Rica D., 3rd Year CE Student</strong>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    “Volunteering at our tech outreach programs taught me that engineering can truly change lives. It’s not just about building systems—it’s about building solutions.”<br>
